## About

I am a systems-driven consultant focused on operational clarity, customer experience optimization, and strategic execution. My background includes high-stakes service environments, escalation-based problem solving, and real-world operational leadership.

I specialize in translating complexity into structured workflows, scalable systems, and high-integrity execution.

Currently, I am building **Inner Resonance** and **Love Loop™**, a wearable technology ecosystem focused on real-time nervous system regulation, biofeedback-driven stabilization, and human-centered emotional technology.
